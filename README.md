# VOSTquod
A Twitter bot that sets things straight 

## CONTEXT

Misinformation is a problem and there aren't enough human resources - or patience - to go after every user that makes a pure RT or a RT with comment of something that is false or misinformation.
SOLUTION

Enter "**Quod**" (latin for "**fact**"), a Twitter bot - on command - starts telling everyone that shares false information that the information is false with a link to the content that debunks it.

## REQUIREMENTS
- Module that allows to paste the tweet with the misinformation and the link to the debunk
- Module that allows to input opening phrases into a DB
- Module that allows to start and stop the bot
- Module that allows to count how many users were warned of the false content
- Module that allows to count how many users deleted the content after being warned
- Module that allows the bot to tweet his interaction on a daily basis: how many users warned, how many deleted the content

## DELIVERABLES

- A secure login page for the bot Administration system
- An interface per each module
- An interface with the counters showing how many users replicated the content, how many were warned, how many deleted it (daily and total) with an image attached to it
- An automatically generated tweet twice a day with stats (how many false tweets detected by team, how many users interacted with, how many users deleted it.)

## NOTES

- This bot should work as a standalone or as integrated with our own VOSTPTia

## Technical Details
- Right now there is no set language to develop this project, although, most of VOST volunteers know PHP, Node.JS and Flutter, we accept every language.
